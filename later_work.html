            <h2>After 1985</h2>
            <p>After 1985 Beksinski moved away from his pure, surreal and fantastical works and became interested in
                <i>digital art</i>. This was popular at the time since <i>photoshop</i> was a <b>new artistic frontier</b> at the time.
                Personally these are <em>not my favorite</em> works of art but some, like the image below captures a unique
                perspective that I am captured by. Perhaps it is the ghostly figure or how lonely the image feels. As I am
                writing this I realise it is hard to write about art and not seem precocious, what a job. Throughout this
                period I  was shocked at how far he pushed the program, sadly he was bound by the <b>limitations</b> of the technology and began to get frustrated. Eventuallly at the
                begining of the 2000's he regressed back into painting.
                This time his paintings were even more abstract with a series of erotic sketches, which for obvious
                reasons I am unable to show. My apologies.

            <h2>The End</h2>
            <p>
                As I said previously he really threw himslelf into his work coming up to his later years
                with some very odd and fascinating works. Sadly in the <i>year 2004</i> which just happens to be my brothers
                birthday, Beksinski was <b>murdered</b> for the equivalent of <b>100 euro</b>, This crime was commited by
                his <em>longterm</em> housekeepers <b>son</b>. In a gruesome act of violence he was
                found with <strong>17 stab wounds</strong>. He was <b>murdered</b>.
                Beksinski was buried in his home-town of <i>Sanok</i> and that year a red cross was erected at the <i>Burning Man
                festival</i> in his Honor.
                He is an icon for painting  and a bastion for <b>dystopian surrealsim</b>. Beksinski was a talent we were all robbed of too soon.
