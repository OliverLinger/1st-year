            <h2>His early life</h2>
            <p>
                In 1929 he was born in the <em>small</em> town of <i>Sanok</i>, <i>Poland</i>.
                Growing up in Poland during the <i>second world war</i>, <i>Beksinski</i> experienced some trully
                <em>horrifying</em> events.
                This could possibly be correlated to the <b>Jewish Ghetto</b> which was set up in his home town. 
                This may give us a insight as to why all his <b>humanoid</b> figures in his paintings appear <em>emaciated</em>. He studied architecture
                in <i>Krakow</i> as a <em>young</em> man. When he completed his studies Beksinski got a job as a <i>construction site supervisor</i>. He
                <em>hated</em> this job and it pushed
                him towards the arts.

            <h2>Artistic beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                He started out as a <b>photographer</b> and <em>quickly</em> gained <b>notoriety</b> for his
                <em>surreal</em> and <em>odd</em> photos.
                <b>At the time</b> photography was all about capturing the moment as it truly was, and Beksinski
                <em>never</em> conformed to this style.
                Beksinski opposed this by photographing people in <em>unnatural</em> positions and obscuring body parts.
                During this time he moved with his family to <i>Warsaw</i>.

            <h2>His start in painting</h2>
            <p>
                Once he had made a suitable stir in the photographic scene he moved on to painting.
                He believed he could <b>not</b> express himself through the medium of photography. He freely donated
                his photographs to a museum, and began painting with no <em>formal</em> art training and most of his paintings draw from his
                <i>architectural</i> background.

            <h2>His attitude</h2>
            <p>
                Despite his <em>somber and grotesque</em> paintings the Beksinski has stated that some of his images are
                misunderstood and downright <em>humorous</em>, in my oppinion many of his paintings are a scathing
                <b>satire</b> of <b>religion and mob mentality</b>. We can see this in his paintings that include hordes of people dying
                at the hands of another group or entity. In this respect I agree that some of the exagerted images could appear <em>comedic</em>
                in their absurdity, However
                I <b>feel</b> that the <em>dark</em> tones do prevail in most of his works.

            <h2>His later life</h2>
            <p>
                He kept painting for decades with his <i>fantastic period</i> being his most famous. When digital art
                became more promenant he used programs such as <i>photoshop</i> to <b>enhance</b> his images. This
                <em>didn't</em> last long as he recognised the <b>limitations</b> of the software. Sadly on the <i>21st of February 2005</i> he died at the hands of his caretakers son.
                What a tragedy.
