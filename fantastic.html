            <h2>Skin Dam</h2>
            <img src="images/skin_dam.jpg" alt="A massive skin structure in the shape of a church">
            <p>This is an unsettling painting of the famous church <i>Notre Dam</i> constructed out <b>flesh</b>.
                <i>Beksisnski</i> often used <b>religious imagery</b> and structures painted in a medieval style. It is impossible to really know
                what he wanted to convey with his paintings so all my assumptions are my own oppinion.
            </p>

            <h2>Death robe</h2>
            <img src="images/death_robe.jpg"
                alt=" A robed figure writing names as a crucified man hangs in the background">
            <p>
                A disturbing feature of his paintings is that the blue you see is in fact a pigment also stained  the
                walls of the gas chambers. This color is from <i>cyanide</i> and hence the robed figure takes on a whole new meaning. The paint
                is called <i>Prussian blue</i>.
            </p>

            <h2>Kissing</h2>
            <img src="images/kissing.jpg" alt="Two deformed figures kissing">
            <p>
                Beksinski painted many <b>emaciated</b> figures during his time some in erotic positions. Often the figures in
                his paintings look necrotic and not fully alive this could be linked to his own personal experiences.
                Many of his paintings follow this <b>erotic</b> theme and it has been prevelant in his art work from
                day one, starting with his photography.

            <h2>Creature</h2>
            <img src="images/Crawler.jpg" alt="A malnourished beast in a fiery wasteland">
            <p>This painting lends more to his gloomy and apocolytic atmosphere that became his staple, the <i>beast</i> walkes
                through the destroyed street with a bandaged head.
                For me, this is an uncomfortable scene that makes me a little upset.
